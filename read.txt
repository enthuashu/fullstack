To create server first we need to have server creater which is called "Express"
Express.js provides an easy way to create web server
To install express server we need to right this command on terminal =>
npm install express


when you install any package from npm than a folder (node modules) is created which contains all the functionality and codes of the downloaded package
Package.json tells a summary about our project
In package.json, dependecies maintains a record of all the npm packages installed

node modules => contains all the codes of downloaded packages
package.json => contains information of the project and dependcies which maintains names of downloaded packages from npm
packagelock.json=> contains additional information about the downloaded packages

We never use/edit these files, these are just additional files which give information

To create server 
npm init
step 0=> install express from npm (npm install express) done
step 1=> import express done
step 2=> app = express() done
step 3=> creating server  app.listen(port,call backfunction)
step 4=> writing codes for every frontend requests which are called API (Application Program Interface)

// Port tells about the address of our server
// localhost is used when we do coding in our local computer
//e.g localhost:8000


// callback function is called when its previous program is completed


Postman

whenever we create a full stack project we first create its backend
we write codes for every kind of requests which will come from frontend in future
Till that time, when we don't have frontend, we need some tool which works as a virtual frontend
for making requests to backend
so basically postman is used to make requests to backend until frontend is developed


// status codes are 3 digit codes sent from backend to frontend which tells about the status of the response
// e.g. 200 for successful response
//      201 when data is created at database
//      400 bad requests
//      401 unauthorized
//      404 not found


// routing is a process of selecting a path 
// routing happens both at frontend and backend
// 1. routing at frontend describes which page to show at which route  (found in urls of browser)
// 2. routing at backend describes which data to sent at which route (api) (found in network tab)


e.g. suppose we need profile information of 1000 users one by one,so we cannot define 1000 apis for every users
we define one api (which works as a function) and this api accepts params which tells about user data requested


Both are closely related but they are not the same at all, params are parameters set for the route, query are values resembling variable assignment that provide extra information on what is being required for the route and it will always start with a ? on the URL
